## 🔥 WHY THIS EXISTS  
We fuse **art, science, history, and activism** to prototype liberatory futures--grounded in community,resistance, and iterative experimentation. Born from a collaborative spark ignited at [Roxbury Community College](https://rcc.mass.edu), in collaboration with STEM, Arts, and Business innovation this project honors Roxbury’s legacy of abolitionist human-centered design and interdisciplinary innovation.
