## 🔥 WHY THIS EXISTS  
We fuse **art, science, history, and activism** to prototype liberatory futures--grounded in community,resistance, and iterative experimentation. Born from the proposed [Liberatory Futures Lab](https://roxbury.edu), this project honors Roxbury’s legacy of abolitionist innovation.
