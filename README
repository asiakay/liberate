The Liberatory Futures Lab operates through a radical, iterative process that merges historical resistance with interdisciplinary action to co-create just futures. Grounded in Roxbury’s abolitionist legacy, the Lab dismantles academic silos by fusing art, science, and activism—studying rebel histories, prototyping tools like abolitionist tech and protest art, and partnering directly with communities to turn theory into tangible change. Its work cycles through learning (oral histories, decolonized knowledge), reimagining (speculative design, Fugitive STEAM), building (mutual aid networks, justice workshops), and refining through feedback, all while centering those most impacted by oppression. This dynamic praxis—both urgent and visionary—insists that liberation isn’t abstract but lived, tested, and fought for in real time.
